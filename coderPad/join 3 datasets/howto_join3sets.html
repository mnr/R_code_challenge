<h3><strong>Join Three Datasets</strong></h3>
<div><span>Data scientists spend about 80% of their time cleaning and preparing data. I've also heard that data scientists spend an additional 10% of their time complaining about cleaning and preparing data. So the more proficient you are at cleaning data, the better data scientist you'll be.</span></div>
<div>&nbsp;</div>
<div><strong>Your task</strong>:</div>
<div><span>In this challenge, you're provided with three data.frames from two different survey companies. The first two data sets are from Acme Data. &nbsp;The third set that you'll obtain is from Star Research. They combined demographic and survey data, but used different column headers than those used by Acme.&nbsp;</span></div>
<ul>
  <li><span><code>AcmeData_Demographic</code> and <code>AcmeData_Survey</code> - For privacy concerns, Acme separated demographic information from the survey results.</span></li>
  <li><span><code>StarResearch</code> - Combined demographic&nbsp;and survey data, but with different column headers than those used by Acme.</span></li>
</ul>
<p>Combine all three of these data frames, then for each house color, identify the individual with the highest income. Return this as a data.frame in the following format:</p>
<table cellpadding="6">
  <tbody>
    <tr>
      <td>firstName</td>
      <td>Income</td>
      <td>houseColor</td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
      <td>Hallie</td>
      <td>50563.2</td>
      <td>Blue</td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
      <td>Natavia</td>
      <td>68595.0</td>

    </tr>
    <tr>

      <td>Red</td>
    </tr>
  </tbody>
